We will bill the monthly or yearly subscription fee plus any applicable taxes to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information). If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current Monthly Period or Yearly Period -this means that you will have continued access to Kivvik Screening for the remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund.

We are unable to accommodate combining free trials with any other offers. To view the specific details regarding your free trial, if any, log in on the Kivvik website and click on Account under your name.

        Once your free trial period ends, we will begin billing your Payment Method for monthly subscription fees corresponding to your subscription plan (plus any applicable taxes), unless you cancel prior to the end of your free trial. For that reason, unless otherwise indicated in the free trial description, you may be asked to set up a valid Payment Method when redeeming a free trial offer.

    <p class="termsContentBody">
        It is very important to understand that you will not receive a notice from Kivvik that your free trial subscription has ended or that your paying subscription has begun.

You can cancel your Kivvik Screening subscription by logging into your Kivvik Screening Account and clicking "Cancel Subscription." We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a monthly basis for your subscription plan until you cancel or the account or service is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to these Terms. You may cancel your subscription at any time as described in the Ongoing Subscription and Cancellation section of these Terms. To the extent Kivvik Screening subscriptions are offered in conjunction with purchases of, or payment for, third party products or services, you agree that Kivvik will not be liable to you for any claims arising out of or related to your purchase or use of such third party products or services.
